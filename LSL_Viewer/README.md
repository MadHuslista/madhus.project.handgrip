# LSL Viewer

## Summary

`LSL_Viewer` is the browser-based visualization tool for the Handgrip Suite. It reads live LSL streams or replay files and displays target/reference signals, XY correlation, and optional validation/marker overlays.

It is an observer and diagnostic tool. It should not redefine acquisition semantics, calibration math, or firmware/bridge contracts.

## When to use this component

Use this component when you need to:

- inspect live `HandgripTarget` and `HandgripReference` streams,
- visually validate target/reference behavior before calibration,
- diagnose XY correlation, lag, or alignment symptoms,
- replay CSV/XDF data for inspection,
- check whether display-only downsampling or axis behavior affects interpretation.

Do not use this component to:

- acquire RS485 data directly,
- parse target firmware UART directly,
- fit calibration models,
- permanently apply filtering/calibration corrections.

## First command

From `LSL_Viewer/`:

```bash
uv run lsl-viewer
```

Live reference-validation mode:

```bash
uv run lsl-viewer mode=live_with_reference_validation
```

CSV replay example:

```bash
uv run lsl-viewer mode=csv_replay \
  reference.target_csv_path=./data/target.csv \
  reference.reference_csv_path=./data/reference.csv
```

## Expected result

Expected successful behavior:

- viewer web UI opens, typically at `http://127.0.0.1:8765`,
- target and reference streams are discovered when `LSL_Bridge` is running,
- target/reference time series update under applied force,
- XY correlation reacts to synchronized force changes,
- keyboard controls such as clear/pause behave as documented.

Stop before calibration if the viewer shows missing/frozen streams or persistent growing XY delay.

## Configuration

Primary config:

```text
LSL_Viewer/conf/config.yaml
```

Main configuration areas:

| Area             | Purpose                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| mode             | live, validation, CSV replay, XDF replay.               |
| stream discovery | Expected LSL stream names and channel labels.           |
| buffers          | Retention windows and sample handling.                  |
| plots            | Time-series, XY correlation, dimensions, axis behavior. |
| server           | Host, port, browser UI behavior.                        |
| keyboard/UI      | Clear, pause, XY lock, toggles.                         |

Full configuration reference is planned at [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md).
