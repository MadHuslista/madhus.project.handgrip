# Handgrip Analysis

## Summary

`Handgrip_Analysis` is the offline signal-analysis and filter-design package for captured handgrip data. It runs staged analyses to characterize startup drift, stationary noise, loaded drift/creep, real handgrip dynamics, interference conditions, and candidate digital filters.

It is file-based by design. Use it after acquisition/calibration data exists, not as the live acquisition authority.

## When to use this component

Use this component when you need to:

- analyze saved target/reference CSV data,
- quantify startup warm-up / zero drift,
- characterize rest noise and spectral behavior,
- measure loaded drift or creep,
- compare real handgrip dynamics,
- evaluate interference conditions,
- rank filter candidates and generate deployment recommendations.

Do not use this component to:

- run live RS485 acquisition,
- publish LSL streams,
- record calibration protocols,
- change firmware constants directly without validation.

## First command

From `Handgrip_Analysis/`:

```bash
uv run ha-run-all --help
```

Run a single stage with the relevant stage entry point or script. Example static-noise run:

```bash
uv run ha-stage2 analysis=stage2 \
  input=data/calibration_signals/example_static_rest.csv \
  outdir=data/analysis_results/stage_2
```

Run from a manifest when prepared:

```bash
uv run ha-run-all \
  manifest=path/to/capture_manifest.csv \
  base_outdir=outputs/batch_run
```

## Expected result

Expected successful behavior:

- input files/manifests resolve,
- the selected stage runs without missing-column errors,
- output folder is created,
- machine-readable metrics are written,
- plots/reports are generated,
- Stage 6 outputs include candidate comparison and a filter recommendation when applicable.

Stop if the manifest cannot be traced to source data or if the selected filter recommendation cannot be linked to metrics.

## Configuration

Primary config tree:

```text
Handgrip_Analysis/conf/
├── config.yaml
├── analysis/
│   ├── stage1.yaml
│   ├── stage2.yaml
│   ├── stage3.yaml
│   ├── stage4.yaml
│   ├── stage5.yaml
│   └── stage6.yaml
├── dsp/
├── filters/
└── io/
```

Main configuration areas:

| Area | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| input / manifest | Source CSVs, labels, channel mapping, batch dispatch. |
| output / IO | Output directory, overwrite policy, report paths. |
| stage configs | Stage-specific windows, metrics, plots, thresholds. |
| DSP defaults | Sampling assumptions, filtering utilities, spectral settings. |
| filter candidates | Candidate families and parameters for Stage 6 evaluation. |

Full configuration reference is planned at [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md).

## Tests

Run from `Handgrip_Analysis/` after dependencies are installed:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

For a quick CLI smoke check:

```bash
uv run ha-run-all --help
uv run ha-stage1 --help
uv run ha-stage6 --help
```

If your installed entry points differ, check the active `pyproject.toml` and update this README plus `docs/workflows/handgrip-analysis.md` together.
